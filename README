A quick howto on using these scripts:

add files and filetypes you want to exclude to backup.ignore
add directories you want to backup to backup.list, according to the format in
backup.list.example

the backup script itself goes in /root/backup and make a directory called /root/backup/files for the actual backed-up files.
